        A dictionary is a reference book, online resource, or tool that provides definitions and explanations for words, phrases, and sometimes even symbols or concepts used in a language. Dictionaries serve as valuable references for people looking to understand the meanings, pronunciations, and usage of words within a language. Here are some key points about dictionaries:

Word Definitions: Dictionaries primarily provide definitions or explanations for individual words. These definitions often include information about word meanings, usage in sentences, and sometimes additional details such as word origins, synonyms, antonyms, and more.

Alphabetical Order: Most dictionaries organize words in alphabetical order, making it easy for users to look up specific words quickly. Entries typically include the word being defined, pronunciation guides, and one or more definitions.

Pronunciations: Dictionaries often include phonetic transcriptions or pronunciation guides to help users pronounce words correctly. This is especially useful for words with irregular or non-intuitive pronunciations.

Part of Speech: Word entries often indicate the part of speech of the word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb) to help users understand how the word is used grammatically.

Usage Examples: Many dictionaries provide usage examples or sample sentences to demonstrate how words are used in context.
